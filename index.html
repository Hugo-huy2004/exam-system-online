            <p>“One of my hobbies is watching TV. There are many fantastic programs for me to  watch. Sometimes I can spend my whole day watching TV. Could you tell me about  TV in your country? Are the programs interesting to you? What is your favourite TV program? What is that program about? How much TV do you watch every day?  Do people in your country watch too much TV these days?  

                I‟m looking forward to hearing from you soon.”</p>
